# structural-wands
This is a mod made by me (John M) that spawns in structures at the click of the mouse. You can generate desert pyramids, sky islands, temples, and the shimmer biome using
these wands. I have also added in three blocks that drag the player towards, give weightlessness or push the player away from the block.
